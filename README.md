# Reinforcement learning practice
Collection of reinforcement learning agents I'm experimenting with and/or found online.

### Purpose of this repo
This is meant to act as a collection of notes, examples, and something analagous to a scratch pad for me to try out reinforcement learning.
Many of the code snippets found in some of these iPython Notebooks are copied (usually verbatim) from blogs or other git repos.
In those cases where I copy code I will post a link to the source at the top of the file.


### Sources / Acknowledgements

Below is a list of some of the sources from which I've "borrowed" code and/or learned from. As I find new material I'll update the list.
